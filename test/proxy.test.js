// TRUST_PROXY decides what the rate limiter counts as "one client", so getting it
// wrong breaks in one of two opposite ways — and only one of them is visible in
// normal use:
//
//   unset behind a proxy -> every visitor arrives as the proxy's IP, so they all
//     share one bucket and the 11th login site-wide locks everyone out;
//   trusted with no proxy -> any caller can set X-Forwarded-For and get a fresh
//     bucket per request, so the limiter may as well not exist.
//
// This suite boots one server each way and pins both behaviours. It runs its own
// servers on their own ports and temp stores so its request budget is independent
// of the other suites' (the limiter is keyed per IP + path).
