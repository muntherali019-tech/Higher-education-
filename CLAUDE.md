# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI assistants (and humans) working in this repository.

## What this is

**Education Academy** (internal package name `whisker-academy`) — a cat-themed
learning game for UK learners, hosted by **Mochi** the ginger cat. It covers four
stages (Key Stage 1, 2, 3 and Higher Education) with AI-generated quiz rounds,
homework photo-marking, a scan-and-solve helper, an AI language teacher, vocational
exam-prep courses, subscriptions, and a parent/teacher portal.

The user-facing README is aimed at people shipping the app; this file is the
orientation map for changing the code.

> **Heads-up:** the repo also contains an unrelated second project in `reelmint/`
> (an AI content studio). It has its own `package.json`, server and deploy config,
> and it is what the GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, "Reelmint CI")
> actually builds. Don't confuse the two. See [The `reelmint/` subproject](#the-reelmint-subproject).

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite 5, plain JavaScript (JSX, **no TypeScript**), ESM
  everywhere (`"type": "module"`). Icons from `lucide-react`. Styling is a single
  hand-written `src/styles.css` using CSS custom properties (e.g. `var(--ginger)`);
  there is no CSS framework or CSS-in-JS.
- **Backend:** a small **Express** server (`server/index.js`) that proxies the
  Anthropic API (keeping the key server-side), plus accounts, cross-device sync,
  classes, goals, weekly emails and Stripe payments.
- **Mobile:** **Capacitor** wraps the web build into an Android app.
- **Data:** a JSON file store by default, optionally Postgres (`server/store.js`).
- **State (client):** React hooks + `localStorage` (keys prefixed `whisker.`).

There is **no test framework and no linter/formatter** configured for the main app.
"Verification" means running the dev server and exercising the flow by hand, and
`node --check` on server files. (CI only runs against `reelmint/`.)

## Common commands

```bash
npm install            # install deps (the SessionStart hook does this automatically on web)

npm start              # run web app (Vite :5173) + API (Express :8787) together
npm run dev            # web front-end only (mode web), instant "mock" unlock for testing
npm run dev:app        # front-end in app mode
npm run server         # Express API only, on :8787

npm run build          # == build:web  -> dist-web/
npm run build:web      # website build (Stripe payments)          -> dist-web/
npm run build:app      # mobile build  (Play Billing/RevenueCat)  -> dist-app/
npm run build:onefile  # one self-contained index.html            -> dist-onefile/
npm run preview        # serve the built dist-web/

npm run cap:sync       # build:app + copy assets into the android/ project
npm run cap:open       # open Android Studio
```

There is no single "run the tests" command. To sanity-check the server without a
browser: `node --check server/index.js` and hit `GET /api/health`.

## Architecture

```
Browser (React)  ──POST /api/claude──►  Express server  ──x-api-key──►  Anthropic API
   src/App.jsx                          server/index.js
```

The **Anthropic API key never reaches the browser.** All AI calls go through
`src/lib/api.js`, which POSTs to the backend (`/api/claude`), which forwards to
Anthropic with the server-side key. The default model is set in `server/index.js`
(`claude-sonnet-4-6`) — change it there, not in the client.

`src/lib/api.js` reads `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE` (falling back to `/api`),
so a production mobile build points at a deployed backend URL. In dev, Vite proxies
`/api` → `http://localhost:8787` (see `vite.config.js`).

### Three builds from one codebase

Selected by Vite `--mode`, which loads the matching `.env.<mode>` file and sets
`VITE_PLATFORM` / `VITE_BILLING`:

| Build | Command | Output | Platform helper | Payments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Web (website) | `build:web` | `dist-web/` | `isWeb()` | Stripe Checkout |
| Mobile (Google Play) | `build:app` | `dist-app/` | `isApp()` | Play Billing via RevenueCat |
| Single file | `build:onefile` | `dist-onefile/` | `isWeb()` | mock (demo) |

`src/lib/platform.js` exposes `isApp()`/`isWeb()`; `src/lib/billing.js` picks the
payment provider from the build (Stripe for web, RevenueCat for app) and falls back
to an instant **mock** unlock in dev. In dev, `VITE_BILLING` defaults to mock; a
production build uses the real provider unless you force `VITE_BILLING=mock`.

## Key conventions

- **JavaScript + ESM only.** No TypeScript, no build-time type checking. Use
  `import`/`export`, not CommonJS.
- **Code style is terse and dense.** Many handlers and helpers are one-liners;
  match the surrounding density rather than expanding everything out. Prefer small
  pure helpers. Match existing comment style — short `//` notes explaining *why*,
  and `/* ---------- section ---------- */` banners in the server.
- **React:** function components with hooks only. `App.jsx` holds nearly all
  top-level state and acts as a screen router via a `screen` string state; feature
  screens are components under `src/components/`. There is no router library and no
  global state manager.
- **State persistence:** client progress lives in `localStorage` under keys prefixed
  `whisker.` (main state is `whisker.v1`, see `src/lib/progress.js`). `defaultState()`
  is the schema of record; `loadState()` merges saved data over it so new fields are
  backward-compatible — add new state fields there.
- **AI prompts live in two places:** `tutorBrief(ks, subject)` in
  `src/data/curriculum.js` gives each stage its tutor "voice"; the request-specific
  system prompts are in `src/lib/api.js`. Most AI functions ask for **raw JSON** and
  parse it with `extractJSON()` (tolerant of markdown fences) — keep that contract if
  you add new ones.
- **Localisation:** user-visible strings are wrapped with `t()`/`useT()` and must be
  registered in the `STRINGS` array in `src/lib/i18n.js` to be translated. AI-generated
  content (quizzes, feedback, lessons) is generated directly in the chosen language via
  a `language` argument to the `api.js` functions.
- **Secrets stay server-side.** Never put the Anthropic, ElevenLabs or Stripe secret
  keys in frontend code or `VITE_*` vars. `VITE_*` values are public (baked into the
  bundle); everything else is read by the server from the environment.
- **Backend data access** goes only through `load()`/`save()` in `server/store.js`,
  which transparently uses either the JSON file or Postgres. The whole dataset is one
  in-memory object (`{ users, children, classes, goals }`); route handlers mutate it
  and call `save(db)`.
- **Auth pattern:** wrap protected routes in the `auth(handler)` helper in
  `server/index.js`; it resolves the bearer token to a user and 401s otherwise.
  `pub(user)` is the only shape sent to the client (never leak `salt`/`hash`).

## Configuration & environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local dev. The key variables:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (required for AI features), `PORT` (default 8787).
  - `AUTH_SECRET` — signs auth tokens; set a long random value in production.
  - `ELEVENLABS_*` — optional premium cloud voice.
  - `STRIPE_*` + `PUBLIC_WEB_URL` — web-build payments.
  - `EMAIL_PROVIDER` / `RESEND_API_KEY` / `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`,
    `WEEKLY_EMAILS_INPROCESS`, `ADMIN_SECRET` — weekly parent-email digests.
  - `DATABASE_URL` — switch the store to Postgres (then `npm install pg`).
  - Build-time `VITE_*` flags (`VITE_API_BASE`, `VITE_BILLING`, `VITE_PLATFORM`,
    `VITE_PRIVACY_URL`, …) are usually set via `.env.web` / `.env.app` / `.env.onefile`.
- `render.yaml` deploys the website as **one** Render service (builds `dist-web`,
  serves it together with the API). Secrets are set in the Render dashboard.
- `capacitor.config.json` configures the Android app (`com.educationacademy.app`).
- `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` runs `npm install` on Claude Code web sessions
  so the dev server/build/API are ready immediately (only in the remote environment).

Deeper operational docs live in the repo root: `DEPLOYMENT.md` (Play Store),
`DEPLOY_WEBSITE.md` (website + API), `PRICING.md`, `COMPLIANCE.md`, `VERIFY.md`,
`LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`.

## The `reelmint/` subproject

`reelmint/` is a **standalone, unrelated** application that happens to live in this
repo. It is a single-service AI content studio (Express API + static web app, **no
build step**) that turns a prompt into videos/images/copy.

- Its own `reelmint/package.json`, `reelmint/render.yaml`, `reelmint/.env.example`.
- Uses the **`@anthropic-ai/sdk`** directly (not the proxy pattern above) with a
  default model of `claude-opus-4-8`, and runs in a clickable **demo mode** when
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset.
- Run it with `cd reelmint && npm install && npm start`.
- **The repository's GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) targets
  `reelmint/` only** — it installs, `node --check`s and smoke-tests the reelmint
  server. It does **not** build or test the Education Academy app.

Treat changes to `reelmint/` and to the main app as independent. Don't cross-import
between them.

## Working here — quick checklist

- Adding an AI feature? Put the client function in `src/lib/api.js` (raw-JSON +
  `extractJSON` contract), reuse `tutorBrief` for stage voice, and pass a `language`
  argument. The server proxy already handles it — no server change needed unless you
  need a new endpoint.
- Adding UI text? Wrap it in `t()` and register the English string in
  `src/lib/i18n.js`'s `STRINGS`.
- Adding client state? Extend `defaultState()` in `src/lib/progress.js`.
- Adding a backend route? Use `auth(...)` for protected routes, go through
  `load()`/`save()`, and never return raw user records — shape them like `pub()`.
- Verify by running `npm start` and clicking through the affected flow; run
  `node --check server/index.js` after server edits.
- Keep the Anthropic/Stripe/ElevenLabs secrets server-side.
