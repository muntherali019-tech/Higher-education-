// Lightweight UI localization. Registered English strings are translated in a
// single batched AI call the first time a language is chosen, then cached on the
// device (localStorage) so they show instantly and work offline afterwards.
// English is the source — t() returns the English string until a translation
// arrives. Brand names/prices/emoji are preserved by the translator.
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { LANGUAGES } from "../data/languages.js";
import { translateBatch } from "./api.js";

// Every English string wrapped with t() across the app.
